<section id="outline"><h2>Outline</h2>
<p>Data portals can facilitate the distribution of open data by providing an easy-to-access, searchable hub for multiple data sets. They often also act as showcases for reuse of data and as a hub for the interested community.</p>
</section>


<section id="ms"><h2>Management Summary</h2>
<section id="challenge"><h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>Public administrations consist of government bodies of differing sizes and often their information systems lack interoperability. Data sets are of different sizes sometimes relating to small localities only, which makes them less interesting to the broader community such as the infomediary sector. Furthermore, the data sets are in different formats which complicates their re-use.</p>
</section>

<section id="solution"><h3>Solution</h3>
<p>A data portal is established by the government (national, regional or local). This may be managed in-house or by a contractor, perhaps from the R&amp;D or education sector where computer engineering students and researchers are involved in direct re-use of data in development of innovative services (web and mobile applications).</p>
</section></section>

<section id="bpi"><h2>Best Practice Identification</h2>
<section id="why"><h3>Why is this a Best Practice? What’s the impact of the Best Practice</h3>
<p>A portal fulfils many functions:</p><ul>
  <li>it acts as a platform through which datasets are made available, catalogued and made searchable;</li>
  <li>it promotes the provision of metadata and makes it easy for that metadata to be added at the time of publication;</li>
  <li>it acts as a show case for applications that re-use the data;</li>
  <li>it can also act as a community hub.</li></ul>

<section id="whyNeed"><h3>Why is there a need for this Best Practice?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To promote and improve interoperability between the different local councils´ information systems.</li>
  <li>To offer a larger volume data sets to re-users, including the infomediary sector.</li>
  <li>To promote the use of open data formats and common vocabularies to facilitate the re-use of data sets.</li>
  <li>To generate interest and engage with the community.</li></ul>
</section>

<section id="whatNeed"><h3>What do you need for this Best Practice?</h3>
<p>Data portal software can be developed from scratch, bought off the shelf or obtained as open source software. The best known example of an open source package is <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>.</p>

<section id="applicability"><h2>Applicability by other Member States</h2>
<p>The approach is applicable to any Member State.</p>
