# Overview
The costs of public sector information in respect to added value has to be assessed taking into account large-scale detour effects and not merely at the level of the publishing organisation.


# Why
The publication of data and information according to regulations, principles, best practices or recommendations generally has a positive effect. However, in cases where the publisher creates a substantial revenue by monetizing the concerned data, the loss of income represents a hard to deny fact which may contribute to the decisions against publishing data or information.

If the only metric applied is whether the department that generates and shares the data receives financial compensation for doing so, then the assessment is very likely to be unfavourable. However, a range of other metrics taken at a higher level will often show significant benefits to the organisation as a whole, such as greater efficiency, improved fulfillment of the public task and increased transparency.

The PSI Directive mandates that data should be available for free or at marginal cost, that is, making the data available cannot itself be a revenue generator although charges may be levied to cover the difference between keeping the data within the organisation and making it available.

Therefore more sophisticated assessments are required as inputs to a publication strategy, taking into account the whole data life cycle. While added efforts or lost income will likely be of an issue for the publisher, a variety of metrics should be used at different levels of the organisation up to the state or community as a whole to assess the value and impact of sharing PSI.

# Intended Outcome
Assessment of the value and impact of sharing public sector information SHOULD be made at a level above the individual department(s) responsible for doing so.

# Possible Approach
The actual implementation of public sector value assessment is very much influenced by the administrative organisational setup. If and open data strategy is implemented at the federal level, chances are high, that impact assessment will also take place at that level. However, even in cases the impact is assessed at higher level but the publishing organisation, possible loss of revenues is required either to be compensated _or_ to be approved.

To facilitate the transition from assessing efforts and value from the local level to a higher level, techniques and methodologies of [management by objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives) or [evidence based government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_policy) COULD be used. The actual implementation will further depend on the level where the PSI directive got implemented. While all EU member states are required to implement  EU directives into national law, some member states forward this obligation to provinces (mostly on [NUTS](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview)-2 level), which adds additional difficulty when erecting holistic measures of costs and effects of data and information publication. Some individual departments, or sub-departments, are likely to see increased costs with no direct benefit to that department but at a higher level, the benefits should be evident and measurable.

Factors to bear in mind include, but are not limited to:
* the reduction in time spent dealing with individual requests for information;
* the reduction in the load on the Web site due to the elimination of traffic from screen scrapers;
* improved delivery of services, perhaps including new services;
* improved transparency, perhaps measured by the number of news items referring to published information;
* improved data quality due to more users able to detect errors.

These are just examples of factors to consider when establishing a more complete and holistic model to assess the added value of published information. While the increased costs of data and information publication get simply measured on a local level, so are the benefits, which are often restricted to the number of downloads of a particular dataset and the number of external applications built on top of the data.

# How to Test
Is the assessment of the provision of PSI done at a sufficiently high level to measure an overall effect, taking into account, but not limited to, individual small-scale budgets.
